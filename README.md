# EmoSync: Real-Time Stimulus Recognition and Prediction through EEG and Hand Movement Analysis

## Data
Original dataset is comming from [Brain Signals And The Corresponding Hand Movement Signals Dataset (BS-HMS-DATASET)](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/brain-signals-and-corresponding-hand-movement-signals-dataset-bs-hms-dataset). Given that the original dataset required some refinement, we conducted a thorough preprocessing of the data, which is now stored in the Data folder for further analysis.

  ### Emotiv
  We utilize data obtained from Emotiv devices, interpreting column meanings directly from the Emotiv website to ensure accurate data handling. After clarifying the column names and data structure, we have neatly organized and stored the files in the "Emotiv EEG" directory. For instance, a file named EEG_Test0_1.csv indicates data from the first individual ("Test0"), with '1' denoting the first session and the first activity (watching the first video). Each participant can generate up to eight files, reflecting two sessions where each session encompasses four distinct activities.
