# EmoSync: Real-Time Stimulus Recognition and Prediction through EEG and Hand Movement Analysis

## Motivation
The problem at the heart of emotion recognition and prediction using EEG and hand movement data is the challenge of accurately identifying and anticipating a user's emotional state based on physiological signals. Traditional methods of emotion detection often rely on observable cues such as facial expressions, voice tone, and body language. However, these indicators can be easily masked or misinterpreted, leading to inaccuracies. Furthermore, individuals with certain disabilities may not express emotions in conventionally recognizable ways, which compounds the challenge.

The goal of this project is to leverage the nuanced, physiological signals captured by EEG brainwave patterns and hand movements to create a more accurate, real-time model of emotional state detection. This approach is necessitated by the limitations of current emotion recognition technologies and the potential benefits that more accurate emotional detection systems could bring to a wide range of applications. By understanding the intricate relationship between the brain's electrical activity, hand movements, and emotional states, we can develop models that offer a deeper, more nuanced understanding of human emotions.
